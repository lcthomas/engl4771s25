# Additional Reading
This page is currently in process. It is meant to act as a starting point for your research for your reception analysis assignment and for your final project. The readings listed below are related to our course. In many cases, I considered including them in our syllabus, but there wasn't enough room. They are organized below by topic or concept, and many of the readings not linked below, unless they are books, can be found in the "additional readings" folder on our course Canvas site (go to Files > additional readings).
