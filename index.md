## Course Description
This seminar investigates the role of social media in contemporary literary production and reception. We will understand both “social media” and “literature” broadly, examining literature about and written for social media, online communities focused on book reviewing such as BookTok and Goodreads, platforms for social reading and writing like Wattpad, and the use of social media by publishers and authors in promoting literature. We will read scholarship in media studies, reception studies, and publishing studies to understand how social media shapes the contemporary literary field and how literature shapes social media. Throughout, we will ask what it means to consider literature as a social phenomenon, foregrounding questions about its conditions of production and the people who read and respond to it online.
