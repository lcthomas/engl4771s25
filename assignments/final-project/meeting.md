# Individual Meeting
## Due
- Week 7 or 8

## Requirements
Please see [the final research paper assignment page](https://lindsaythomas.net/engl4771s25/assignments/final-project/paper.html){:target="_blank} for a description of its requirements.

At some point during week 7 or 8, you will meet with me to discuss your initial idea for your final project in this class. These meetings will be about 20 minutes long. You should come to the meeting with a concrete, if preliminary, idea about what you think you want to write about in your final research paper due at the end of the semester. This should include:
1. At least one primary text you want to write about (this could be a work of literature, social media posts, or both);
2. An early articulation of your research question.

The purpose of this meeting is to help you prepare to write your final project proposal, which is due Friday, March 14. I expect your ideas to grow and change during and after this meeting, so you will not be committed to anything we discuss.

## Scheduling
As the time for these meetings nears, I will post a Calendly link to this page that we will use for scheduling them.
