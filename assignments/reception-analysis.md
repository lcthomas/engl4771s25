# Reception Analysis
More coming soon!


You may revise your reception analysis and re-submit it to me for re-grading. Re-grading means that I will read, comment on, and grade your essay again as if from scratch, without taking your previous grade into account. This revision will be due two weeks after you receive feedback and your grade from me. I strongly recommend you come to office hours or make an appointment to talk with me about the feedback I gave you if you plan to revise.
