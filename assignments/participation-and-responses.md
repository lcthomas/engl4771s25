# Active Participation and Weekly Reading Responses
More coming soon!

There are many ways to participate in this class, including:

1. Raising ideas from our assigned materials for class discussion and/or from your weekly written responses to them, including directing our attention to specific moments you found evocative, inspiring, unexpected, or otherwise salient;
2.	Asking questions about materials or ideas or passages you found puzzling or difficult (I cannot overstate how valuable good questions are to a thriving class, and how desperately I wish more students were courageous in asking them);
3.	Bringing pertinent materials discovered outside of class to our attention during discussion;
4.	Assisting classmates in group activities or other in-class work;
5.	Expressing appreciation for something a classmate has said in class in specific terms and describing how it has deepened, extended, changed, or otherwise affected your thinking;
6.	Visiting office hours to extend course conversations around subjects or questions you find particularly interesting and/or to ask for additional feedback on your writing.
