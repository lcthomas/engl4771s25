# Course Info & Policies
## Required Materials
It is very important that we all read and work from the same editions of the below novels. We will often read passages together in class, and it is \*essential\* to the culture of our class that we all reference the same editions with the same paginations. I therefore ask that you please obtain the PRINT editions of the below novels. I have ordered all of the below books through the Cornell bookstore and they should be available to you via CAMP. Digital editions of the below books should be used as a temporary stop gap or as a last resort only.

You may also check the below books out from our library and/or using [Borrow Direct](https://cornell-borrowdirect.reshare.indexdata.com/){:target="_blank"}. Additionally, I also have limited numbers of each text available to lend to students. Please talk to me if you encounter difficulties with or have questions about accessing these texts in print; I will help you find a solution.

## Course Requirements
### Attendance, Active Participation, and Weekly Reading Responses (30%)
You are expected to come to class having completed the reading and assignments listed for each day and prepared to discuss it. Your successful participation in class depends on your preparation. Be sure to complete the reading and other assignments for each class session. Because this class only meets once a week, more than 1 unexcused absence may affect your course grade. Please arrive to class on time.

In addition to doing the reading for each week's class and participating actively in class discussion, you will also submit at least 6 brief responses to the week's assigned reading throughout the semester. These responses will be graded on completion, and they are due the night before class each week (e.g., Wednesday nights). Throughout the semester, there will be 7 opportunities to complete a reading response; you must complete 6 of them to receive full credit in this area.

### Reception Analysis (25%)
4-5 page essay analyzing the reception history of one of our course texts.

### Final Project (45%)
15-18 page research project on a topic of your choosing. Completing this project will involve completing a number of small preliminary assignments, including:
- At least one meeting with me in which we discuss your preliminary ideas;
- 1-2 page proposal;
- 2-3 page research synthesis with associated bibliography;
- Detailed final project outline;
- 7-8 minute final project presentation

All of the above preliminary assignments will be graded on completion.

## Policies and Information
### Language, Power, and Difficulty
This class takes seriously the need to examine rather than censor or look away from the messiness, complexity, and, often, ugliness of history and the present. At the same time, our classroom is a contingent community and I treat it as such: we must be accountable to and respectful of each other as we collectively create a space for discussing difficult, and at times uncomfortable, issues.

In that spirit, I want to make explicit that some of the texts we will study this semester use the n-word and other slurs. We will not repeat these words aloud in class. While these words have a complex history of reclamation and resignification, they are not appropriate for casual classroom use.

Furthermore, throughout the semester we will read about events that are upsetting, to say the least. Our course texts concern forms of institutionalized oppression, personal and structural violence, and abuses of human rights such as sexual assault. Several of our course texts also include sexually explicit scenes and scenes involving drug use. Please approach our readings and class discussions with maturity, thoughtfulness, and care for yourself and for others in the class.

### Technological Failures Are Not Emergencies
Technological failures and mishaps – file corruption, computer crashes, wifi connection problems, uploading the wrong file to Canvas – are predictable facts of twenty-first century life. They happen all the time and are thus NOT emergencies. You therefore need to develop strategies that take such failures into account. Start your work early, save it often, and save it to an external hard drive or in the cloud using services like Dropbox and Google drive. Technological failure or mishap – including uploading the wrong file to Canvas – is not an excuse for late or unfinished work.

Please note that I will read and respond to whatever you upload to Canvas for grading. It is your responsibility to turn in the correct version of your assignments.

### Course Digital Infrastructure
We will make use of multiple online systems and programs in this course: a course site, a shared Google drive folder, a Canvas site, and Zoom.

* Course site: We will use our course site to manage course information and our schedule. You will find an online version of our course calendar there (including the most up-to-date version of reading assignments and due dates), as well as an online version of our course syllabus. You will also find all course assignment sheets there, as well as links to online materials.

* Shared Google drive folder: You will submit your weekly reading responses to a shared Google drive folder. This folder will be accessible to everyone in the class so that your classmates can read your responses.

* Canvas: Most of our course readings will be available via our Canvas site (excluding online-only material or print books). You will also submit assignments other than the weekly responses via Canvas, and I will use Canvas’s Gradebook to record your grades. You will also be able to access our individual meeting Zoom link (see below) via Canvas.

* Zoom: I will hold office hours in person, but for meetings outside of office hours, I can meet with you either in person or on Zoom. If we meet on Zoom, we will utilize a standing Zoom link for our meeting. You can find this link via our Canvas site. To meet with me on Zoom:
1.	From our Canvas site, click on “Zoom” in the left menu.
2.	This will take you to a page where you will see our standing class Zoom link (which is titled “ENGL 4771 COMBINED-XLIST Social Media and Contemporary Literature (2025SP)”). Click “Join” to join the meeting.
3.	These meetings will not be recorded. I have enabled a waiting room for these meetings, which you will enter first when signing on. I will then let you into the Zoom room. If I do not let you in right away, this means I am meeting with another student.

### Email
You should check your Cornell email account regularly; I will send course information and announcements through email. I endeavor to respond to all emails that you send me within 24-48 hours during the working week and within 2-3 days over the weekend or breaks, but please do not send me urgent emails regarding your assignments in the day or hours before they are due and expect a reply.

I am happy to answer simple questions about the course via email, but I will recommend that you talk to me in office hours or in a meeting about more involved questions and conversations about course material, assignments, and policies. In fact, the best thing to do in almost any situation that affects your class work is simply to talk to me about it. I am also happy to read and discuss advance drafts of your assignments with you in a one-on-one meeting, but I will not read and comment on drafts of assignments via email before they are due.

### Attendance
Attendance is required. Because our class only meets once per week, more than one absence may affect your overall grade. Please communicate with me about course absences, especially if you need to miss more than one class. Please save your absence for when you need it.

If at any point in the semester you are ill for an extended period of time, or if there is an emergency, please let me know as soon as possible. We will work out a plan to make up the work you will miss in class.

### Late Work
Please communicate with me in advance if you will need more time to complete an assignment. Assignments submitted more than one week late will not be accepted (late reading responses will not be accepted at all). It is your responsibility to keep up with assignments and to submit them properly and on time.

On a personal level, like everyone else, I dislike being lied to. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with asking for a little more time to complete an assignment. You do not need to concoct elaborate stories if requesting an extension on an assignment, or even offer any explanation for this request at all. You can just ask for more time, and we will work it out.

### Academic Integrity and AI Writing Tools
All students are expected to adhere to the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity. Please see the Code of Academic Integrity at <https://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/dean/academic-integrity/code-of-academic-integrity/>. The Code states, “A Cornell student’s submission of work for academic credit indicates that the work is the student’s own. All outside assistance should be acknowledged, and the student's academic position truthfully reported at all times.” Plagiarism will result in a 0 on the assignment and is also possible grounds for failure of the course or expulsion from the university.

Representing text generated by AI writing tools – such as chatGPT, or AI tools embedded into Google docs, Grammarly, or other programs – as your own writing is a violation of this policy and will be treated as such.

If you use AI writing tools to assist you in the writing process, you must explicitly label all artificially generated text that appears in your paper, just as you would label any text written by someone other than you. This means that all text generated by AI must appear in quotation marks, and you must cite it just as you would cite any other source.

If you use AI writing tools to help you write your paper, or to help you brainstorm or generate ideas for your assignments, or to help you revise your own writing, you must acknowledge this explicitly in a statement at the end of your paper. Here are some examples of what this statement might look like: “I incorporated sentences written by chatGPT into the following paragraphs of my essay...”, or “I used chatGPT to brainstorm ideas for this paper...(then go into more detail about what ideas it helped you brainstorm),” or “I used chatGPT to correct my grammar and punctuation in paragraphs 2, 3, and 5 of this paper,” or “I used chatGPT to format my Works Cited page,” etc. Please be specific in this statement about which tool(s) and model(s) you used (i.e., the specific version of chatGPT, AI tools integrated into Google docs or another kind of software, etc.). Finally, include 2-3 sentences concretely describing what you see as the benefits of this tool for your writing process. If you did not use AI writing tools to help you write your paper at any stage, you should append the following statement to the end of your paper: “I did not use AI writing tools to assist with any part of my writing process.”

That being said, I want to challenge you not to use AI writing tools to help you write your papers for this course. The goal of writing is not only to communicate your thinking about the course material; it’s also to *do that thinking yourself.* Writing is thinking, and I am interested in what YOU have to say – not in what chatGPT or other large language models can generate about a given topic. Your ideas, analyses, and interpretations are much more interesting than anything a language model can produce, and your grade will depend much more on the quality of your analysis and the complexity and clarity of your ideas than it will on the “polish” of your writing. Text generated via large language models is often dead behind the eyes, clichéd, and boring. Your essays should not be boring.

### Accommodations and Accessibility
It is important to me that you can access this course and its materials and complete its assignments.
